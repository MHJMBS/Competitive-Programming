# Competitive Programming

Everything I produced practising competitive programming, i.e:

## Solutions

Solutions to several contests problems from competitive programming websites, such as:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/)
- [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/)

## Library

A library containing algorithms and data structures useful in contests. It's purpose, besides increasing my efficiency in online contests, is to make me practice their ideas and implementations.

## Template

A code snippet to be used as a starting point for every problem in a contest, containing frequently used code such as aliases and definitions, in order to avoid rewriting them from scratch everytime.
